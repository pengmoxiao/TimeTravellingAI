## Development experiences

In the process of using AI to develop the game TimeTravellingAI, I deeply realized the great help and potential of AI technology for game development. First of all, AI can provide smarter interactive experiences in game design. Whether it's generating dialogues through natural language processing or using machine learning to optimize the player's gaming experience, AI can greatly enhance the game's immersion and interactivity. For example, the plot development and the behavior of NPCs (non-player characters) in the game are provided based on ideas from AI.

Secondly, AI also plays an important role in code optimization and automated building. During the development process, AI can help analyze potential problems in the code, provide optimization suggestions, and even automate testing and fixing some of the bugs, which greatly saves development time and cost. In addition, AI can also assist in generating art content when building the game, automatically generating character models, scene designs, etc., which improves the efficiency of creation.

However, there were still some problems when using the AI: the AI's imaginative ability was insufficient to generate a detailed game based on the outline, and in some cases the bugs could never be corrected. And it also couldn't be combined with the picture background, resulting in a very ugly first draft. In this aspect of details, manual labor needs to do a lot of processing.

Through this development practice, I have become more aware that AI technology not only enhances the gameplay and graphics, but is also a key force in promoting innovation in game design thinking and development methods. In the future, with the continuous development of AI technology, game creation will become more intelligent and personalized, bringing players a richer interactive experience.
