## Development experiences

In the process of using AI to develop the game TimeTravellingAI, I deeply realized the great help and potential of AI technology for game development. First of all, AI can provide a smarter interactive experience in game design. Whether it's generating dialogues through natural language processing or using machine learning to optimize the player's gaming experience, AI can greatly enhance the game's immersion and interactivity. For example, the plot development and the behavior of NPCs in the game can be generated ideas through AI. Secondly, AI-generated images have more choices, are more personalized, and are also very realistic, which greatly meets our needs.

Secondly, AI also plays an important role in code optimization and automated building. In the development process, AI can help analyze potential problems in the code, provide optimization suggestions, and even automate the testing and fixing of some of the bugs, which greatly saves development time and cost. In addition, AI can also assist in generating artistic content when building games, automatically generating character models, scene designs, etc., improving creative efficiency.

However, there are still some problems when using AI: AI's imagination ability is not enough to generate a detailed game according to the outline, and some times the bugs have not been able to be corrected. And it also can't be combined with the picture background, resulting in the first draft is very difficult to see. In this aspect of details, manual labor needs to do a lot of processing. Some times, AI can't fully understand what we mean, such as when generating pictures, I told him not to generate people, but it still generates them.

Through this development practice, I realized that AI technology not only improves the gameplay and graphics, but also promotes the innovation of game design thinking and development methods. In the future, with the continuous development of AI technology, the creation of games will become more intelligent and personalized, bringing players a richer interactive experience.
